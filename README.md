# WorkoutTracker
Aging is rough. As I get older and as more aspects of life compete for my time and attention, it's harder and harder to maintain my fitness. While Iâ€™m no professional athlete and certainly not a bodybuilder, I do regularly lift weights to maintain muscle mass and bone density. I currently track my workouts using a spreadsheet. While this enables me to measure progress, it is not exactly convenient.  Enter the WorkoutTracker.

WorkoutTracker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with C# (with Blazor Webassembly) and JavaScript.  A PWA allows for the convenience of a mobile or desktop application (I plan to use WorkoutTracker on my iPhone) without the hassle of lengthy and tedious App Store approvals.  WorkoutTracker is designed to be completely self-contained and offline-capable; it uses IndexedDb for data persistence, leveraging a custom JavaScript interface mimicing MongoDb's query and update interfaces.
### Code:You Capstone Project Features
1. Generic Class for IndexedDb integration; stores and retrieves data for multiple Types
2. Asynchronicity
3. Multiple inter-related entitites
